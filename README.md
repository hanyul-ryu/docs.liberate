# Welcome to Liberate.FHE!

Liberate.FHE is an open-source Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) library for bridging the gap between theory and practice with a focus on performance and accuracy.

Liberate.FHE is designed to be user-friendly while delivering robust performance, high accuracy, and a comprehensive suite of convenient APIs for developing real-world privacy-preserving applications.

Liberate.FHE is a pure Python and CUDA implementation of FHE. So, Liberate.FHE supports multi-GPU operations natively.

The main idea behind the design decisions is that non-cryptographers can use the library; it should be easily hackable and integrated with more extensive software frameworks.&#x20;

Additionally, several design decisions were made to maximize the usability of the developed software:

* Make the number of dependencies minimal.
* Make the library easy to understand and modify.
* Set the usage of multiple GPUs as the default.
* Make the resulting library easily integrated with the pre-existing software, especially Artificial Intelligence (AI) related ones.

Anyone can easily start to use Liberate.FHE by following [Quick Start](getting-started/quick-start.md) after installing the library via [Installation](getting-started/installation.md).
